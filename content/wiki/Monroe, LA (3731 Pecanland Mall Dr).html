<b><i>3731 Pecanland Mall Dr</b></i> was a <i>Chuck E. Cheese's</i> that opened in July 9, 2011 with a <a href="{{< ref "wiki/Studio C Beta" >}}">Studio C Beta</a> and closed in August 2024 (Unknown Day), after 13 years in operation.
The Chuck E. Cheese Animatronic was installed incorrectly onto to show which led to its eyelids being stuck upwards and the head being stuck tilted for years. The Show itself was updated at some point from 2017 to 2020 to have LED lighting; at the same time, new fur arms, jeans, feet, and miscellaneous repairs for the Chuck E. Animatronic.

<h2> History </h2>
Monroe opened in July 9, 2011 as a Phase 4 store with a Studio C Beta stage. It also featured the 2013 update to the 2005 CEC Remodel Program, which included early Rockstar decor. The location temporaily closed sometime in late 2020 due to the company's bankruptcy. Sometime around 2023, the location received the 2016 cards update, which resulted in the removal of several token games, though getting newer games. The location closed permanently due to underpreformance, likely due to the nearby Tilt Studio that opened in 2019 inside of Pecanland Mall.
